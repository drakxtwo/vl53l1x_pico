# vl53l1x_pico
micropython driver for the vl53l1x ToF sensor

Originally taken from the OpenMV project's vl53 driver located here: https://github.com/openmv/openmv/blob/master/scripts/libraries/vl53l1x.py and then modified (simple mods) to allow the VL53L1X sensor from pimoroni (maybe others) to be used on the Raspberry Pico
